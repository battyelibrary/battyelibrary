            <h1>Funding</h1>
            <p>Revenues gained through membership subscriptions, fund raising activities, publications sales, gifts, bequests (such as the Sholl Bequest), and grants are spent on various projects submitted by staff of the State Library of Western Australia and the State Records as well by members of our organisation to the Friends' Committee for selection each year.</p>
            <p>Large projects have required extra effort including applications for large external grants. The last of these was funds of $3 million from Lotterywest, supported by the consortium of historical and community organisations and private donors, to rescue and preserve unique and irreplaceable materials in the Battye Library.</p>

            <h2>Maude Sholl Bequest</h2>
            <p>Maude Sholl was a well-wisher who left a substatial bequest for the use of the Friends of Battye Library Inc.</p>

The Sholl Bequest is our major source of regular funding.</p>
